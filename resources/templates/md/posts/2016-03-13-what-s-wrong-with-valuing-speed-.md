* lay out tech debt as good argument
* agree with some points
* opposite side of spectrum
    * craftsmanship
    * slippery slope - http://dannorth.net/2011/01/11/programming-is-not-a-craft/
* problems
    * need to always test
    * if possible edge cases, fail fast and report
    * no drive to make code "better" (what does better mean in this case?)
    * speed does not mean as fast as you can type to save time

* not an excuse to write bad code and not learn new ways to write good code
